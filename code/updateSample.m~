%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% updateSample is a function which evolves the sample of particles along the exponential map, and calculates the
% the likelihood
% 
% INPUT: 
%	frame	 - the image
% 	m_k	 - the boundaries of the particles
%	x_k	 - the control points of the particles
%       mu_k	 - the mean of the state (it is currently set to zero from outside of the program)   	 
% 	Sigma	 - sigma for covariance
% 	Sigma_0  - sigma for projection	
%	Sigma_1  - sigma for shape space	
%	dt       - time step size
%	nofSteps - number of steps in ODE
%	par_obs  - obervation likelihood parameters
% 	
% OUTPUT:
%	m_k_new  - the boundary pts after the reparameterization, before the evolution (TRICKY)
%       x_k_new  - the control pts after reparameterization before the evolution (TRICKY)
%	w_k_new	 - the weights of the particles
%       alpha_k - the alpha with which the particles get evolved
%
%	Warning: i am not really returning the deformed curves and control points!!!
