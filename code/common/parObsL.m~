% This function initializes the parameters of the observation likelihood based on 
% the initial frame (it assumes the initial boundary correctly segments the region 
% of interest).
% 
% INPUT:
% 	V0 - a matrix representing the first frame in the video sequence
% 	bdryPts - a (nofBdryPts,2) arrray containing the locations of the 
%		boundary points of the object in the first frame
%       2*W - an integer specifying the width of the block for a block observation likelihood
%	2*H - an integer specifying the height of the block for a block observation likelihood
%
% OUTPUT:
%	par_obs - a variable containing all the parameters needed to compute the 
%		observation likelihood
