This repository contains code and data to regenerate results from the preprint "Modeling and Estimation of Shape Deformation for Topolgy-Preserving Shape Tracking" submitted to SIAM Journal of Imaging Science on May 3,2013 authored by Valentina Staneva and Laurent Younes.
DOI:10.1137/130919714

Tracking Scripts:
-----------------
run_sim1
run_sim2
run_hearts
run_paramecium0
run_paramecium
run_fish (!)


Simulation functions:
---------------------
sim_ellipse
sim_ellipse2

You don't need to run the simulation functions separately, they will be called by run_sim1 and run_sim2. All scripts except run_fish will work (run_fish requires fish_data.mat which could not be uploaded to github due to size limitations). Waiting for Large File Storage!

All the results will be stored in the initially empty results folder.

Tested under Ubuntu 12.04 and Kubuntu 12.04, using MATLAB R2012a with Parallel Processing Toolbox.
