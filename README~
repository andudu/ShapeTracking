This repository contains code and data to regenerate results from the preprint "Modeling and Estimation of Shape Deformation for Topolgy-Preserving Shape Tracking" submitted to SIAM Journal of Imaging Science on May 3,2013 authored by Valentina Staneva and Laurent Younes.

Tracking Scripts:
-----------------
run_sim1
run_sim2
run_hearts
run_paramecium0
run_paramecium
run_fish


Simulation functions:
---------------------
sim_ellipse
sim_ellipse2

You can run the tracking scripts in any order. You don't need to run the simulation functions separately, they will be called by run_sim1 and run_sim2.

All the results will be stored in the initially empty results folder.

Tested under Ubuntu 12.04 and Kubuntu 12.04, using MATLAB R2012a with Parallel Processing Toolbox.
